    "Abstract:\n",
    "Interpretability is a key property for the acceptance of Machine Learning models by decision makers and regulators. While the trade-off between complexity and performance is not only intrinsic from Machine Learning models but permeates all the human decisions, the problem aggravates as we lose control in sensitive domains. In this session, we will discuss the problem of interpretability and explanatory Machine Learning, from traditional models such as Decision Trees to Deep Neural Networks. We will discuss how to obtain heterogeneous explanations that aim to explain the decision with multiple approaches.\n",

    "About the speaker:\n",
    "Kelwin Fernandes holds a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Universidade do Porto (2018) and a Computer Engineering degree (summa cum laude distinction) from Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (2012). Recently, he founded NILG.AI, a consulting company in Data Science with clients working in multiple areas (healthcare, telecommunications, fraud detection, among others). He has helped dozens of companies to incorporate AI into their daily operations."
