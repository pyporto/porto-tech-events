    "Back to the beautiful Porto this time we are going to change things a bit. From the other side of the big pond (aka Atlantic), Pedro Saleiro, a researcher at University of Chicago with plenty of Porto blood running in his veins will talk to us about a very important topic in Data Science nowadays, Bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are we placing our own bias in our work as data scientists? What is the outcome of those bias in real life? How can we move towards unbiased data science?\n",

    "Come, Pedro will show us the way\u2026.\n",

    "Talk : Title: The Bias Report: in search of equity in algorithmic decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract : Algorithmic decision making systems are being increasingly used in problems that can have drastic impact on people\u2019s lives in policy areas such as criminal justice, education, public health, workforce development and social services. Recent work has raised concerns on the risk of unintended bias in these predictive models against people from specific groups, often under-represented, based on race, gender, religion or age, among other characteristics. We present an open source bias audit tool that machine learning developers and policymakers can use to understand different types of biases, and make informed decisions around developing and deploying algorithmic decision making systems.\n",

    "Short Bio : Pedro Saleiro is a post-doctoral research fellow in the Center for Data Science and Public Policy, University of Chicago. He has been working with Rayid Ghani since November 2017 in bias and fairness issues in Machine Learning, mainly in the scope of Public Policy problems. From 2012 to 2017, Pedro was a postgraduate researcher in the Artificial Intelligence Lab (LIACC), University of Porto, pursuing a PhD (ML, IR and NLP) under supervision of Carlos Soares and Eduarda Mendes Rodrigues."
