    "## 19h00 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Small introduction to the Porto Codes project, and a warm up to the night's presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19h30 \"Go 2 Draft Designs\", Diogo Pinela\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Go\u2019s most distinguishing features among modern programming languages is its fairly minimalistic feature set, which makes it particularly simple to read and write. Some of the omissions, however, have had definite drawbacks, most notoriously the inability to write type-generic functions and data structures and the large amounts of error-checking boilerplate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, the core Go team has released a set of draft designs (https://golang.org/s/go2designs) for solutions to address these problems, in order to gather feedback from the community. We\u2019ll explore the ideas they put forth and how they might change the way we write Go.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20h30 Dinner + Santini (icecream)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have dinner downtown, please let us know of any dietary restrictions so we can plan accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards it is customary to go for icecream at Santini and continue the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Porto Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Porto Codes is a meetup for local and international programming enthusiasts. The talks are recorded and published with the presenters' consent as one of our goals is to provide programming resources to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reach us on Slack (https://invite.porto.codes) if you are interested in presenting or chatting with us!"
