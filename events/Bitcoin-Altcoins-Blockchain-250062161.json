    "Bitnation is providing governance services independently from nation-state jurisdictions. It enables individuals as well as entire communities to reclaim their sovereignty by creating jurisdictions on the blockchain. We are currently working on the very infrastructure that will enable DApp developers to build governance services and entire nations (DBVNs: Decentralized borderless voluntary nations) on top of our Pangea platform. Pangea will include ID and reputation services, as well as Ethereum smart contracts to sign agreements, create new laws as well as DBVNs. One critical function of a jurisdiction is dispute resolution. We will provide a market of arbitrators competing for reputation and clients, in stark contrast to existing court services that consume time and money.\n",

    "What Bitnation is trying to accomplish is to enable people all over the world to live independently from the geographic apartheid that is imposed upon us by nation-states. People should enjoy high-quality governance services without being discriminated against based on their place of birth. The value we aim to provide is to enable everyone with a smartphone to opt-out from the system they live in without having to move geographically. To choose governance services freely just like you choose your phone provider.\n",
