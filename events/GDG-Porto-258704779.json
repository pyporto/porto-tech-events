    "\"Reactive Forms are a mainstay in the Angular ecosystem yet a lot of developers limit their usage to just Login pages or traditional input collection. In this talk, I will showcase how you can take advantage of the full power of Reactive Forms to build some really powerful state-driven solutions. This talked will be based on a real-world personal experience of building complex data-driven healthcare solutions with Reactive Forms. I will also showcase some really common use cases in a Lot of angular applications that may not be obvious for the application of Reactive Forms. We will explore the hierarchy of Reactive Form Controls and showcase some smart ways to implement custom validation inside of your Angular application. The main aim of this talk is to enable users to be aware of what is at their disposal and how they can take advantage of the full power of Reactive Forms.\"\n",
