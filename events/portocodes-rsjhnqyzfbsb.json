    "\n",
    "Home Automation seems to finally be spreading and growing, with a lot of new products getting to the market with affordable prices. Unfortunately, many of those products use their own proprietary interfaces, so we end up with isolated products that don't talk to each other, and that rely on cloud-based services (which may be unreliable or slow due to network conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are many ways to make some of these proprietary products work locally, interact with each other and centralize them, allowing us to control and manage them from a single service, instead of using a different app for each device. In this talk, we will discuss some of the ways to do that using open-source software like Home Assistant. We will also take a look at some of the most common technologies used in Home Automation, and even how to get rid of proprietary firmware and use open-source ones!\n",
