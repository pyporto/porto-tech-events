    "The Portuguese Association for Biofabrication (APB) would like to invite you to participate in the\u00a01st Meeting of the Association, which will be held in Porto (Portugal) on June 15th, 2018. The aim of this meeting is to create a forum where all individuals interested in Biofabrication, namely researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, from academic, industrial and medical sectors are able to share experiences and ideas through the dissemination of the latest research undertaken in Portugal and abroad in the field of Biofabrication.\n",
    "We hope that this 1st Meeting will lay the first stone in bringing together the Biofabrication community in Portugal. This event will be entirely free, therefore, we hope to meet you all in Porto.\n",
