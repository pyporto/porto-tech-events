    "Livestreaming of The London CryptoCurrency Show in Porto. \n",
    "The London CryptoCurrency Show is an exciting one-day event and exhibition geared towards helping active investors and traders learn more about this incredible opportunity. Recent massive demand for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin has pushed prices very high over a very short space of time. This might be what\u2019s known as a financial bubble, and prices might correct after the gold rush is over, but many in the industry believe that the underlying developments of blockchain technology (the platforms which allow cryptocurrency to operate) are here to stay. \n",
    "There are numerous future applications in the business world, as well as the new opportunity for companies to raise new funds through Initial Coin Offerings (ICO\u2019s), or \u2018tokens\u2019, providing today\u2019s investors with a new dawn for building wealth. \n"
