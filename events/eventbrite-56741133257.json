    "Hackacity is a hackathon which challenges data scientists and enthusiasts to enrich the data provided by the city so they can be used to think and develop solutions that have impact in the life of city\u2019s citizens and visitors.\n",
    "Everything started in the year 2015, in Porto, when 7Graus and the City Hall of Porto decided to gather the technological community to create solutions and to trigger a co-creation\u00a0environment. The initiative happened for several editions in Porto and afterwards extended to other European and Brazilian cities.\n",
    "Now, on the forth edition in Porto, we want to increase the level technological and intelectual challenge level."
