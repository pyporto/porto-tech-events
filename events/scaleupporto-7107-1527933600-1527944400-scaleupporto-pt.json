    "There is no agenda and no speakers. It\u2019s for those who is ready to start a weekend with a cup of hot coffee and a chat with like-minded python developers. We come together with our laptops, our news, project ideas or challenges to help and to talk to each other. \n",
    "To be frank, we are not sure what it turns into, that very much depends on each of us. We welcome everyone, from beginners in Python to seasoned developers. Hopefully, together we can build a strong and inclusive community of people willing to share their knowledge and their passion with each other.\u201d \n",
