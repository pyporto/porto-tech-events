    "Once more in Coimbra, the city of knowledge, this time it\u2019s our vision that commands the way. As Data Science deepens its influence in our world, visual information is becoming the queen. With Jo\u00e3o Duarte and Marco Sim\u00f5es, researchers at CIBIT-ICNAS, we will travel to the depths of our own brains and discover how can brain imaging and machine learning help shape the future of neurology and medicine in general. Will the machines become a sidekick doctor in the future?\n",
    "From the inside to the outside, we will explore the importance of data visualization with Beatriz Malveiro, Data Visualization Engineer at Feedzai, who will take us on a journey on how our eyes consume visual information and how important is to shape good data visualizations for a successful data science project.\n",

    "Talk 1: Can brAIn imaging help Dr. House?\n",
    "The technological advances and cooperation between brain imaging and machine learning communities have revolutionized modern medicine. Often, there are features in the structure-function relationships in both healthy and pathological brain that are invisible to human eye. The use of machine learning\u2019s ability to unveil hidden patterns is increasing, especially in the development of new therapeutic strategies and diagnostic tools. This talk will cover different data processing approaches for extracting features from brain images (MRI and EEG) and their use to infer characteristics of the individuals and classify them into groups.\n",

    "Talk 2: Visual Explorations: the world of dataviz and its challenges in product\n",
    "When it comes to data, looks matter. Our brains are wired to visually decode information so let\u2019s understand how we can use it. In this talk, we will take a look at the world of data visualization and why it matters in the life of a data scientist: From the powerful and crucial role of visualization for data exploration, to the wonders of visual storytelling for effective communication. We\u2019ll also explore how dataviz helps fight fraud at Feedzai and the challenges of building data visualization tools for product.\n",

    "Beatriz Malveiro is a mathematician who always took too long choosing fonts and color schemes for dull LaTeX documents. She has a MSc in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico and took on several graphic design projects throughout university. After graduating she merged both these interests and discovered the field of data visualization. Nowadays, Beatriz works as a Data Visualization Engineer in the Data Science team at Feedzai where she equips data scientists with dataviz tools to fight fraud."
