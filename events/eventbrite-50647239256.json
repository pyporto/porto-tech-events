    "Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a primary method to examine gene expression, nevertheless, it requires a well-considered design. Richelle Spanjers will discuss the steps to a successful qPCR experiment including design criteria, experimental design considerations, and the methods of quantification. These considerations for qPCR are also applicable to the new digital PCR (dPCR) approaches. In addition to the design parameters, this discussion will also explore how the sensitivity of qPCR and dPCR assays can be increased with novel internally quenched, 5\u2019 hydrolysis probes which increase sensitivity through lower fluorescent background. Also, IDT has developed a new RNase H2-depented PCR method to improve specificity in gene expression and allelic discriminations studies. The method relies on cleavage of a 3\u2019-blocked primer by the use of a RNase H2 enzyme which helps prevent primer-dimer artifacts and non-specific amplification. "
