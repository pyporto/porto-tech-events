    "switchSENSE\u00ae is a unique platform that combines high sensitivity kinetics with structural information. Here, we will measure the interaction of an anti-human Carbonic Anhydrase 1 (hCA1) antibody with hCA1. Additionally, we will determine the hydrodynamic diameter (DH) of hCA1 in nm and compare it to the crystal structure-derived DH.\r\n",

    "switchSENSE\u00ae technology delivers unrivaled information on a single platform\r\n",
    "dynamicBIOSENSORS\u2019 pioneering switchSENSE\u00ae platform is a user-friendly, fluorescence-based\u00a0biosensor chip technology for the real-time measurement of binding kinetics (kON, kOFF) and affinities (KD). Uniquely, protein size can be accessed in addition. The innovative measurement principle is a change in the movement of DNA nanolevers mounted on micro-electrodes. Interactions between proteins, DNA/RNA, small molecules, and liposomes can be detected with femto-molar sensitivity. Using minimal amounts of sample, protein diameters (DH) and conformational changes are analyzed with 0.1 nm accuracy, as well as protein melting transitions (TM).\r\n",
    "Unrivaled, the dual-color DRX\u00b2 analyzer enables the simultaneous measurement of two different interactions on the same detection spot. This offers the possibility of on-spot referencing or dual-binding modelling, ideal for bispecific interactions.\u00a0\r\n",
    "Learn about the technology and how to apply it to your own projects in a scientific talk and hands-on experiments during the demo week at i3S!"
