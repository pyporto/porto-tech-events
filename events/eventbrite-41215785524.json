    "On 22 & 23 March 2018, Porto will host the 2nd BioTech Pharma Summit: Biosimilars & Biologics 2018. This year\u2019s flagship event will gather top EU, US, Asia and global regulators, officials, healthcare actors as well as industry leaders, to foster open exchange and debate on the role of the biosimilars & biologics medicines sector.\r\n",
    "With more U.S., Europe biosimilars continuing to receive FDA/EMA approval, it is critical that bio/pharmaceutical companies develop strategies to comply with evolving regulations, mitigate risk and execute long-term decisions to prepare for success.\r\n",
    "Biosimilars will lead to $54 billion less in direct spending on biologics (or about 3% of total spending on biologics) over the next decade. The range of the new savings estimate given reasonable ranges of key assumptions, such as the price of biosimilars versus reference biologics and biosimilar market share, varied from $24 billion to $150 billion from 2018 through 2027.\r\n",
    "\u00a0The BioTech Pharma Summit: Biosimilars & Biologics 2018\u00a0is the leading event to continually stay on the pulse of the biosimilars\u2019 ever-changing market and convenes key stakeholders including biosimilar and innovator pharmaceutical manufacturers, payers, providers and patient advocates addressing timely challenges and best practices for biosimilar product success\r\n",
