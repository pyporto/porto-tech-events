    "Welcome to our 17th meetup about DevOps and it's culture, values and practices. The meetup will be hosted by DevScope.\n",

    "Over the past 8 years, the DevOps movement was the stimulant to create a large number of new tools, lots of them open source, some not. A large number of those tools got announced as the ultimate #devops tool, think about Puppet, Chef, Vagrant, Docker, Kubernetes etc. and a lot of the developers and operations folks jumped on these tools. Often, even to a point where the tool was more important than the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then came the idea of the Full Stack engineer.. like the person who does kernel development, front-end development and everything in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now it's time for the Dull Stack Engineer, the Engineer who knows what's running on his platform, focusses on servicing the business and not just his need of new and fancy tooling, the engineer who collaborates with his peers rather than running Docker because it's the cool thing to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are vary happy to share that our invited speaker is Kris Buytaert and we will share his point of view in this subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kris Buytaert (https://twitter.com/KrisBuytaert) is CoFounder & CTO at Inuits and long time Linux and Open Source Consultant. He spends most of his time working on bridging the gap between developers and operations with a strong focus on High Availability, Scalability, Virtualisation and Large Infrastructure Management projects hence trying to build infrastructures that can survive the 10th-floor test, better known today as the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kris is one of the instigators of the DevOps movement and is actively promoting the DevOps idea! He has written about the same subjects in different books, papers and articles and is frequently speaking at, or organizing different international conferences including DevOpsDays!\n",
