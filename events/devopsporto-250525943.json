    "In a fast paced and agile world organizations have to move fast so that they can deliver high value to their customers. Continuous Delivery is a major trend in tech industry, but we cannot compromise quality for speed. Companies need to adapt their delivery process for such a frequent release schedule.\n",

    "How can you adapt your growing test suite so that you are not trapped in a \u201cslow\u201d delivery process? How can you divide tests in types and levels for a better optimization? What tests should you have for your specific project?\n",
    "But it's not just about tests. How can you design your pipelines to cope with this new testing mindeset? How can a DevOps mindset help a team be more productive while having a better testing coverage? This talk aims to explain how to deliver better software in a fast way at the same time.\n",
