    "In this masterclass, Lukas and Michele will show promising new defense-in-depth techniques to protect modern web applications from old and new classes of bugs: Suborigins to have finer-grained control over origin boundaries, Site Isolation and XSDB against Spectre and Meltdown attacks, and last but not least Origin and Feature Policy.\n",
    "In addition to that, our guests will explain new features of the upcoming CSP 3 specification like 'unsafe-hashed-attributes' and give an overview of how we were able to enforce CSP as a strong mitigation against cross-site scripting on over 50% of production web traffic at Google.\n",
