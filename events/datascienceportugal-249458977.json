    "\n",
    "This time Rui Quintino, a R&D Data Researcher at DevScope, will talk to us about Automated Machine Learning and how leaving some of the work to the robots might helps us in the long run. Will they become our overlords? Maybe Rui knows the answer\u2026\n",
    "Jo\u00e3o Lopes and Raul Azevedo, from WeDo Technologies will bring us a talk on the challenges that WeDo Technologies faces in Risk Management, where an open world that generates huge amounts of Data also exponentiates the potential of risky situations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Is \"the sexiest job of 21st century\", the Data Scientist, about to be automated? How & when can AutoML tools help on a typical machine learning lifecycle? What AutoML challenges are still open & what ML work will remain in the foreseeable future? Most importantly\u2026 will robots get all the fun & sex appeal? :) Some questions we'll try to tackle on this session.\n",

    "Digital Transformation is reshaping the world we are living in, forcing businesses to adapt being the alternative a slow death as the transformation evolves. It is also changing the way Risk Management is done in order to overcome the challenges of handling the huge volumes of data continuously being produced in a more open and interactive digital context. At WeDo Technologies we believe Machine Learning is key to overcome these challenges and therefore have been changing the way we used to use it. In this session, we are happy to share the work we are doing in the area of predictive analytics and forecasting, based on one of the Labs Projects we have ongoing right now.\n",
