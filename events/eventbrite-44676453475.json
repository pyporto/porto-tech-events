    "SCOPE\r\n",
    "The recognition that TEM/STEM and SEM coupled with EELS, EDS and in situ holders can be used as a powerful tool for characterization of materials has been widely established. Recently, the study and development of nanomaterials, a field which is quickly becoming one of the most promising fields of science and technology today, and the development in electron optics, detectors, stage design and fabrication, and recording media has brought an exciting resurgence of interest in TEM.\u00a0 The goal of this symposium is to bring together a wide variety of researchers with interests in the science, engineering and technological applications to discuss the use of TEM/STEM and SEM techniques on the characterization and modification of properties of materials.\r\n",
