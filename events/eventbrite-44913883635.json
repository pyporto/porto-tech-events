    "\"Unity Technologies have rightly spotted the gap in the market and have managed to address it with a suitable approach that solves many issues for evaluating Game Design and Development skills of individuals. This is especially useful for graduates as they can officially demonstrate their skills to prospective employers. It also reduces the risk of employing developers and graduates as they can now support their CVs with an official evaluation. Finally, this approach also helps the Higher Education to align their focus with the industry standards.\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Dr. Damon Daylamani-Zad, Senior Lecturer, Department of Computing & Information Systems, University of Greenwich\n"
