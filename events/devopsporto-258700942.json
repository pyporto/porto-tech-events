    "Welcome to our 24th meetup about DevOps and it's culture, values and practices. This meetup will be held at XING new offices.\n",
    "\n",
    "As companies grow, the need for a DevOps Mindset that shapes its processes from scratch is essential. Not having this culture and centralizing it to a single team or putting it too late into action can be catastrophic for an organization as it walks towards fully automated processes.\n",

    "On this talk, our invite speaker Domingos Silva (https://www.linkedin.com/in/domingos-da-silva/), will not only talk about \u201cThe DevOps way of life\u201d but how we can achieve a perfect synchronization between all of the areas inside a company so that automation becomes a creed and not so much of an imposed rule by the bosses while we keep in mind the UX and UI of it for the people involved, with some practical examples along the way.\n",
