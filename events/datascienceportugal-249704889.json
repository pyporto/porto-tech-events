    "Talk 1: Information era: Forcing the quantum leap\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract : Most of today\u2019s companies are not yet close to master the information era, specially those coming from the offline world. While broadly accepting the importance of data & analytics, in practical terms, it is no easy task linking analytical activities with valuable outcomes in a consistent way. Also, the knowledge production processes are highly inefficient, from the data extraction phase up to the final step of presenting the results. This talk aims to share some experience on how to tackle such difficulties and the evolving role of a data scientist as a major contributor for this to happen.\n",

    "Talk 2: What the hell are they talking about?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract : A call center is made of interactions: from calls made by sales teams trying to publicize and sell their products to customers calling for support and guidance. Are we able to automatically find the subjects (or topics) that appear in a call? Can we find the trends in topics over the last weeks? With the help of Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm, we will try to answer these questions.\n",
