    "\n",
    "\"Every Android developer has heard about MVP and MVVM patterns. Even without so much effort, we can explain what is the meaning of the \u201cV\u201d, \u201cP\u201d and \u201cVM\u201d in this acronyms. However, have you ever thought about what is the purpose of the \u201cM\u201d which stands for \u201cModel\u201d? Are we still following its original definition or have we just misused it to describe those patterns?\n",
    "In this talk, I am going to introduce you a reactive architecture for Android which uses the model according to its original interpretation. Do you know how this story will end? And what if coroutines step into the game\u2026?\"\n",
