    "Our flagship event, the\u00a0'Annual Meeting', is the one you certainly don't want to miss! It is the event where over 100 Alumni, previously students and employees within the EIT Digital ecosystem, cross their paths once again to learn from each other, discuss together trending hot topics, listen to inspiring speakers, have fun and spend an amazing long weekend with old and new friends.\n",
    "In 2017, at our first Annual Meeting in Brussels, over 80 members from 35 countries gathered together for 2 days of inspiring talks and networking. Last year our Annual Meeting in the Dolomites reunited 99 members in Trento, Italy, for 3 unforgettable days of knowledge sharing, outdoor sports, enriching workshops and an adventurous night at the Science Museum!\n",
    "This year we want to bring that festive spirit again, and do more! After a marvelous city and the brave mountains, the stunning beaches facing the Atlantic Ocean await us! We promise this edition in Porto will be epic!\n",
    "As always, we offer you a broad range of activities which will not only boost your career from a professional and personal point of view, but will also allow you to take a short holiday with the people you love surrounded by a stunning environment and relaxing views.\n",
    "The programme covers a multitude of areas, from tech talks and hands-on workshops to exciting tours around the region of\u00a0Port Wine\u00a0and surfing in the Atlantic Ocean.\n",
