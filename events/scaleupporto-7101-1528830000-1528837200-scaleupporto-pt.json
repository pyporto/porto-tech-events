    "\u201cWe could not let everyone go on vacations without having another OPO.js event, supported by the ScaleUp Porto initiative. \n",
    "This time we\u2019ll have three speakers!\n",
    "We\u2019ll be welcoming Benjamin Coe (https://twitter.com/BenjaminCoe), Product Manager at npm. Inc, Pedro Teixeira (https://twitter.com/pgte), Software Engineer at Protocol Labs, and Robin Drexler (https://twitter.com/RobinDrexler), Software Engineer at XING SE, who\u2019ll be gracing us with three tech talks, and a lot of unexpected errors. \n",
    "Afterwards, everyone\u2019s invited to join us for dinner at Francesinhas Al Forno da Baixa (https://facebook.com/francesinhasalfornodabaixa). We kindly remind you we ask the restaurant to reserve a seat for you, so:\n",
    "\ud83d\udc49 It would be awesome if you could secure your seat for the dinner as well, when you register for the meetup, considering we need an estimate of how many people are attending, so that the wonderful people who will be feeding us don\u2019t freak out last minute. Be sure to follow the instructions on the image in the comment section!\u201d \n"
