    "Docker is turning 6! Over the last 6 years, Docker Community members have found amazing and innovative ways of using Docker technology in a variety of different projects. This year, we\u2019d like to celebrate you! If you\u2019ve been working on a cool project using Docker technology, come and show your local community. If you\u2019re new to Docker, come along to listen and learn. All attendees will receive a DockerCon discount code.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a short intro presentation, participants will each have 10-15 minutes of stage-time to show everyone how they have been using Docker (and perhaps get some feedback from others). The presentations do not need to be polished and they can be purely personal, fun projects. Presenters will get a Docker Birthday #6 t-shirt and have the opportunity to submit their Docker Birthday Show-and-Tell to the DockerCon Call For Papers.\n",
