    "\n",
    "How can we, as citizens, social entrepreneurs and tech experts, join forces to solve the greatest challenges of our time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Disruptive technologies like #Blockchain, #DataScience, #MachineLearning, #IoT and #NewManufacturing open new possibilities and push boundaries every day. They empower entrepreneurs to bring their solution to a scale and pace that was out of reach 3 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that a technology-first approach to solve the XXIth century challenges is a risk if taken in isolation from the local context and the specifics of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we need to spark-up collaboration from the need on the field to the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "// WHO SHOULD ATTEND?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tech specialists, social entrepreneurs and anyone who wants to learn and share ideas & experience about disruptive technologies in the context of social entrepreneurship!\n",

    "Bring your ideas, questions, experience, will to learn and share, and be prepared to be surprised and discover a whole new world of tech & social initiatives!\n",
