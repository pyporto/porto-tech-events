    "\u00a0FAQs:\n",
    "What is OMA LwM2M?\n",
    "OMA\u2019s\u00a0LightweightM2M\u00a0is a device management protocol designed for sensor networks and the demands of a machine-to-machine (M2M) environment.\u00a0With LwM2M, OMA has responded to market demand for a common standard for managing lightweight and low power devices on a variety of networks necessary to realize the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT).\u00a0The LwM2M protocol features a modern architectural design\u00a0based on REST, defines an\u00a0extensible\u00a0resource and data model and reuses\u00a0and builds on an efficient secure data transfer standard called the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), standardized by the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF) as a variation of the Internet\u2019s HTTP. LwM2M has been specified by a group of industry experts at the Open\u00a0Mobile Alliance\u2019s Device Management Working Group and is based on protocol and security standards\u00a0from the IETF. The LwM2M specification is freely available at\u00a0LightweightM2M.\n",

    "What is an OMA TestFest?\n",
    "OMA TestFests are designed to achieve a number of goals, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring the quality of OMA specifications\n",
    "Enabling vendors to verify and test the interoperability of their product implementations in a multi-vendor environment\n",
    "Provide a peer-to-peer networking environment for participants\n",
    "\n",
    "TestFests are held in a confidential and secure testing environment where companies can bring their Client or Server implementation(s) based on an OMA Enabler to test in multiple multi-vendor combinations. These events are open to both OMA member and non-member companies and are protected by a non-Confidentiality Agreement, (NDA).\n",
    "\u00a0\n",
    "Who is able to attend an OMA TestFest?\u00a0Do I have to be an OMA member?\n",
    "No, both OMA member and non-member companies are invited to participate in TestFest events. The event is\u00a0open to the public to companies who\u00a0have a LwM2M implementation (Client or Server) available for testing or any OMA Enabler for which we have 3 clients and 3 servers registered for testing.\u00a0\n",
    "\u00a0\n",
    "Are TestFests confidential?\n",
    "All OMA TestFests are run as confidential events and therefore all participating companies are be required to agree to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) preventing the discussion or distribution of testing information and results beyond the community of participants in the TestFest.Where a participating company wishes to bring engineers from another company to assist in their testing efforts, please note that it is the responsibility of the participating company to ensure that the 3rd party engineers attending are legal covered and obey the requirements of the OMA NDA. OMA will work with participants to ensure a full level of confidentiality is available to ALL participants, including protecting product identities, designs, product capabilities, test results, etc.\u00a0Companies who do not have a signed NDA on file with OMA prior to the start of the TestFest will not be permitted to participate.\n",
    "Find the NDA here.\n",
    "\u00a0\n",
    "I have registered, now what?\n",
    "At the close of registration, OMA will evaluate whether there is enough clients and servers for each enabler for them to test against each other. If you are the only client or server registered for a particular enabler and you have no one to test against then unfortunately we will have to cancel the testing for that enabler.\n",
    "Once registration closes, OMA will begin to create a formal testing agenda that will be distributed to participants on-site. More detailed travel and event information along with FAQs will be distributed via email to all participants once registration closes.\n",
    "If you require a Visa letter in order to attend the OMA TestFest, please click here.\n",
    "\u00a0\n",
    "Where do I stay? What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?\n",
    "The event is being held at the Marriott AC Hotel Porto. Recommended hotel includes:\u00a0Marriott AC Hotel Porto.\u00a0Transportation info and further hotel information can be found here.\u00a0\n",
    "\u00a0\n",
    "Can I update my registration information?\n",
    "Registration information cannot be updated on EventBrite. For any updates on your registration, attendance, ticket, and/or implementation information, please email Michelle at mjanata@omaorg.org.\u00a0\n",
    "\u00a0\n",
    "Is my registration/ticket transferrable?\n",
    "Yes, if you would like to transfer your ticket to another employee of your company or for another implementation, please just email Michelle at\u00a0mjanata@omaorg.org\u00a0with your update.\n",
    "\u00a0\n",
    "Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\n",
    "No, this is not required. Please do bring an ID or business card for check-in.\n",
    "\u00a0\n",
    "What is the refund policy?\n",
    "Refunds for implementations will not be issued. You may change your implementation up until the registration deadline of Friday, March 1st by emailing Michelle\u00a0mjanata@omaorg.org with your updated implementation information, including which enabler you will be testing. Any\u00a0no-shows will not be refunded. Refunds will only be issued to those implementations that are cancelled due to not enough clients and servers registered for a particular enabler."
