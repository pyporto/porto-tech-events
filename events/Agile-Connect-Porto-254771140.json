    "Releases vs Sprints: How can we handle these two iterations to better manage priorities and expectations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever faced any issues related to releases mid-sprint? Or the fact that the Product Owner expects a release by the end of the sprint but you actually have to wait a bit longer than that? How should we manage those expectations, or the fact that releases and sprints might be separate iterations? These questions will be the basis of this talk. I\u2019ll approach some of the concerns I\u2019ve heard for the past years from development teams. We\u2019ll discuss how we can handle them in the best way possible, so we\u2019re prepare to do, in the future, even faster and frequent releases and how it will affect the teams and the way we define deadlines.\n",
