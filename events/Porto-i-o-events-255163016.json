    "Coffee Cupping is a way of observing tastes and aromas of brewed coffee and comparing it to other roasts. You will learn and taste the difference in some of the coffee aspects, like its body/texture, acidity, sweetness, flavour, and aftertaste. Some people will argue that this is an exact science, but we think that any coffee enthusiast is able to enjoy the experience.\n",

    "- The man behind Luso Coffee Roasters (https://www.facebook.com/lusocoffeeroasters/), Diogo Amorim (https://www.facebook.com/diogo.amorim.7). Luso is one of the most important Portuguese coffee roasters. Diogo actually graduated from a Coffee degree (it's true, there is such a thing!) and has travelled and imported from the biggest/better coffee producers all over the world, from Ethiopia to Brasil. He will bring his beans to the game.\n",
