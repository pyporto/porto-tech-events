    "Father of Malu and Ana Clara, husband of Cris, Jo\u00e3o Reis (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jreisstudio/) (@jreisstudio) is an Agilist passionate about software development and Visual Thinking. His strongest belief is that \u201cIndividuals and interactions\u201d are really more important than \u201cprocesses and tools\u201d, and tries to collaborate on building teams around this concept.\n",

    "Subject: Visual Engagement - Visual thinking while adopting emergent practices in agile teams\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract: Emergent Practices and Visual Thinking are wide concepts that for many times become subjective in our discussions. During the past few years a lot has been said about these subjects disconnectedly, but do we really understand? What are Emergent Practices? Why should we use them? Isn\u2019t Visual Thinking just about doing a little drawing instead of writing? Do these two things work together?\n",

    "This workshop aims to demonstrate through simple practices how Visual Engagement can support the adoption of Emergent Practices in a daily basis of agile teams providing clarity to complex decision making.\n",
