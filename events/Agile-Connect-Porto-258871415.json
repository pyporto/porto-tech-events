    "\n",
    "Working remotely is becoming more and more mainstream and planting the seeds for being a paradigm shift in the way we work in the near future. Its reputation is mostly sunshine, rainbows and drinking margaritas on the beach while working but there are some very dark alleys in this path, most of the times not so well known. This talk will talk about \"both sides of the barricade\", what works, what definitely doesn't work, some tips to avoid going in the \"dark alleys\" and how to make this all work.\n",
