    "We are proud of what we've achieved so far thanks to you! There's nothing better than embarking on a journey that harnesses the best of the collective. This year's gatherings have been a big hit. We have covered a wide range of topics and shared and learned tons of hackish stuff we can put into action in our daily lives, or at least heard something to have a good laugh about.\n",
    "If you didn't have a chance to take part in this great community have no fear, we are already cooking up some goodies for all the geeks out there.\n",
    "Next time, we will be going down and dirty by exploring some tricks from the guys that don't mind to share their hand in advance. Join us in our 6th meetup of this year to listen to some real insights from the world of bug bounties and Capture the Flag (CTFs) challenges.\n",
    "Stay tuned for more and be ready for another fun and joyful evening!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (https://oposec.herokuapp.com/) to discuss all kind of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with others members.\n",

    "Hope to see you soon.\n",
