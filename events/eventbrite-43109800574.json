    "F1/10 is an international competition which exposes you to the foundations of perception, planning and control in a fun, and challenging environment. Participating teams race vehicles with similar hardware specification and try to outsmart, and outpace each other in a battle of algorithms. Many former F1/10 race engineers are now employed in Tesla\u2019s AutoPilot group, Nvidia\u2019s DrivePX AV group, Ford\u2019s AV group, among others.\n",
