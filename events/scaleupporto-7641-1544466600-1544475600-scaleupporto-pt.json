    "Machine Learning is a pathway of many outcomes and not all of them are perfect. It\u2019s time to address both edges of the sword that we aspire to use. In this meetup we will hear Nuno Moniz from FCUP/INESC TEC which will show us the not so pretty side of Machine Learning. Lu\u00eds Roque, CEO of HUUB will, in turn, tell us the story of the company he has helped to found, and how Machine Learning in this case revealed the positive edge of the sword.\n",
