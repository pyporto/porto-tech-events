    "Deep neural networks have shown high performance on image classification tasks. However, due to its complexity, it usually takes a long time and a lot of computational resources to train deeper neural networks. Deep Residual networks (ResNets), can make the training process easier, faster and even allow to build deeper networks. In this presentation we will take a look on how ResNets work and the breakthroughs they allowed to make in the world of computer vision.\n",

    "Doors will open around 18:30 and we'll start the talk after a quick introduction of the meetup, around 19:00. After the networking we can grab dinner nearby!\n",
