    "Our first speaker Dimitri Herrero is the Tech Lead of Business Intelligence at Kiwi.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his talk Dimitri reviews and compares the tools that are now available to explore data and train machine learning models. If you are a data scientist or enthusiast, you are probably using Jupyter Notebooks to explore data. However, when working as a team, we have several tools such as Google Collaborator, Google Datalab, Amazon SageMaker, etc. that could be a better fit when collaborating with others.\n",

    "\n",
    "Artur Mindiiarov is a Data Engineer at Kiwi.com. He will be talking about the ongoing effort to make data open and accessible to everyone. He shares how using the power of graph databases and natural language processing they built a Slack chatbot, helping them in finding the right information. It\u2019s all built in Python (of course!) with help of Elasticsearch, Neo4j and Dialogflow."
