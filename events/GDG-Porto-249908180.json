    "My very first contact with Android was in 2011 but it only started to make part of my professional life around 2014. During that time I developed several apps in the most different areas, going from entertainment to corporate apps (IoT, mobile games, cloud). Currently I continue my relationship with the green robot at Blip, where I started to focus more on Architecture and SOLID design principles.\n",

In this talk we will travel through the huge changes that this versatile component of the Android SDK has suffered during the times. We will also see how it is to setup a basic implementation of a well working WebView and compare the most common usages whilst pointing the pros/cons and also some curious challenges."
