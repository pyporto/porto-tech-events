    "During the\u00a0Start & Scale Week\u00a0Founders Founders\u2018ll be organising a unique Scale Me Up session. Instead of the \u201cusual\u201d scaling-up of a resident startup, this time we\u2019ll scale-up the Porto\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem. \n",
    "This means the resident founders will share their constructive feedbacks & plans for the future of the Porto\u2019s startup environment with the Vice Mayor and City Councillor for Innovation and Environment,\u00a0Filipe Ara\u00fajo. \n",
    "Resident founders will share their insights about the Porto\u2019s start-up reality. They will identify the advantages & disadvantages and also address the necessities & opportunities. \n",
    "No powerpoint, no pitch, no show. \n",
    "Join us! \n"
